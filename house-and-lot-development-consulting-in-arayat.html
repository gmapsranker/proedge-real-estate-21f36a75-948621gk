      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our initial property development consultation fee starts at ₱15,000, which includes site assessment, zoning verification, and preliminary recommendations. For a 200 sqm lot in Arayat, a complete development plan typically ranges from ₱45,000 to ₱75,000, depending on the complexity of your project and specific requirements. This includes detailed architectural plans, cost estimates, and construction timeline planning. We provide a detailed breakdown of all costs during our initial consultation."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The timeline varies based on your project's scope, but typically follows this schedule: Initial consultation and site visit (1-2 days), preliminary assessment report (3-5 business days), development plan drafting (2-3 weeks), and final documentation (1 week). For properties in Arayat, we also factor in additional time for local government permits and zoning clearances, which usually takes 2-3 weeks. In total, you can expect the complete process to take 6-8 weeks from start to final plan delivery."

This includes coordination with the Arayat Municipal Planning and Development Office, securing zoning clearances, and obtaining building permits. We have established relationships with local government offices and understand Arayat's specific building codes and zoning requirements. However, please note that government fees for permits are not included in our consultation fee and will be billed separately."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We conduct thorough due diligence as part of our initial assessment. If we discover title issues or zoning restrictions, we immediately notify you and provide solutions. For title problems, we can recommend trusted local real estate attorneys. For zoning issues, we work with the Arayat zoning office to explore possible variances or alternative development approaches. Our fee includes one round of revision to address such issues, though extensive legal work would require additional services."

This covers construction oversight visits (2 visits included), contractor coordination, and technical clarifications of the development plan. For projects in Arayat, we can also recommend reliable local contractors and suppliers. Additional site visits or extended support beyond 6 months is available at ₱5,000 per visit or ₱15,000 per month for ongoing consultation."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been working with ProEdge for about 8 months now on developing our family lot in San Juan Bano. They really know their stuff when it comes to local regulations and soil conditions. Grace from their team helped us navigate the permit process which was a huge relief. Only small issue was some delays with the initial surveying appointment, but they made up for it. Overall solid experience, would recommend them to anyone looking to develop property in the area.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Super thankful to ProEdge, especially to Sir Mike! We were totally lost about what to do with our inherited property near the municipal hall. They helped us understand our options and even connected us with good contractors. The consultation wasn't cheap pero sulit naman. They saved us from making expensive mistakes. Taking one star off because sometimes medyo matagal sila mag-reply sa messages, but their actual work is excellent.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Best decision we made was hiring ProEdge for our subdivision development project in Cacutud. Their team did thorough site analysis, handled environmental compliance, and even helped us optimize our lot configurations. What impressed me most was how they considered future flood risks in the design - something we hadn't even thought about. Special shoutout to Engineer Santos who went above and beyond. Worth every peso we spent!</div>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How much does it typically cost to get a property development consultation for a 200 sqm lot in Arayat?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our initial property development consultation fee starts at ₱15,000, which includes site assessment, zoning verification, and preliminary recommendations. For a 200 sqm lot in Arayat, a complete development plan typically ranges from ₱45,000 to ₱75,000, depending on the complexity of your project and specific requirements. This includes detailed architectural plans, cost estimates, and construction timeline planning. We provide a detailed breakdown of all costs during our initial consultation.</div>

                        <summary>How long does the entire consultation and development planning process take?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The timeline varies based on your project's scope, but typically follows this schedule: Initial consultation and site visit (1-2 days), preliminary assessment report (3-5 business days), development plan drafting (2-3 weeks), and final documentation (1 week). For properties in Arayat, we also factor in additional time for local government permits and zoning clearances, which usually takes 2-3 weeks. In total, you can expect the complete process to take 6-8 weeks from start to final plan delivery.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we handle all required permits and approvals as part of our service. This includes coordination with the Arayat Municipal Planning and Development Office, securing zoning clearances, and obtaining building permits. We have established relationships with local government offices and understand Arayat's specific building codes and zoning requirements. However, please note that government fees for permits are not included in our consultation fee and will be billed separately.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">We conduct thorough due diligence as part of our initial assessment. If we discover title issues or zoning restrictions, we immediately notify you and provide solutions. For title problems, we can recommend trusted local real estate attorneys. For zoning issues, we work with the Arayat zoning office to explore possible variances or alternative development approaches. Our fee includes one round of revision to address such issues, though extensive legal work would require additional services.</div>
